<!-- About the Project -->
## :star2: About the Project

Imagine a game of "rock paper scissors".
In this task, you have to create 5 rocks, 5 papers, and 5 scissors.
Rocks, papers and scissors are square containers. The difference between them can be shown using colours, text, and images.
We will randomly drop these objects on our screen. After that, these objects will start moving in a random direction. These objects will bounce off the wall if they hit the wall (we consider screen boundaries as walls) . If two objects collide, two things can happen:
If two objects are of the same type e.g. two rocks, then they will bounce. If two objects are not of the same type, one of them will be removed from the screen and the winner will bounce e.g. if a rock collides with a scissor, the rock will win, the scissor will be removed and the rock will bounce and move in the opposite direction.
